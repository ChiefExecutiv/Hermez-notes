Hermez-notes
This is a simple notes app created in react(jsx),I've leveraged the novel rich-text editor by steven tey. You may notice, it has no dataBase integration, all the notes are stored in local storage. Folder organisation is freaking terrible, code format could use some work. Still has multiple bugs in it so if you have any suggestions or would like to modify it yourself, you're absolutely free to do so, infact I do recommend it
